    <p style="background-color:orange;">Early astronomers noticed patterns in the sky and attempted to organize them in order to track and predict their motion. Known as constellations, these patterns helped people of the past to measure the seasons. The movement of the stars and other heavenly bodies was tracked around the world, but was prevalent in China, Egypt, Greece, Mesopotamia, Central America and India.

        The image of an astronomer is a lone soul at a telescope during all hours of the night. In reality, most hard-core astronomy today is done with observations made at remote telescopes — on the ground or in space — that are controlled by computers, with astronomers studying computer-generated data and images.
        
        Since the advent of photography, and particularly digital photography, astronomers have provided amazing pictures of space that not only inform science but enthrall the public. [All-Time Great Galaxy Photos]
        
        Astronomers and spaceflight programs also contribute to the study of our own planet, when missions primed at looking outward (or travelling to the moon and beyond) look back and snap great pictures of Earth from space.</h4>
        An expanding universe of knowledge
            Over the following centuries, astronomers around the world formalized the study of the sky by creating detailed catalogues of stars, star clusters, and nebulae. After discovering Uranus in 1781, William Herschel opened new areas of research in 1800 by discovering infrared radiation – a type of light that is not visible to the human eye.
            
            Others took advantage of rapid progress in the fields of optics and imaging. In 1923, Edwin Hubble fundamentally changed the scientific view of the universe when he used the 2.5 m-diameter Hooker telescope to prove that the Andromeda Nebula extends beyond our Milky Way Galaxy.
            
            Hubble's discovery of the universe's ongoing expansion also paved the way for other astronomers to theorize its origin. The big bang theory, first proposed by Georges Lemaître, was later bolstered by strong evidence: the discovery of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), faint "noise" left over from the massive explosion that gave rise to everything in the universe. The CMB was accidentally discovered by radio astronomers just five years before the 1969 Apollo 11 Moon landing.</p>
