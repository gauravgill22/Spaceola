    <h3 style="background-color:DodgerBlue;">The future of astronomy: three BIG reasons to be excited
        STFC and the world’s BIG telescopes
        In celebration of Global Astronomy Month – #GAM2019, #OnePeopleOneSky – we’re taking you on a galactic journey of the world’s biggest, most advanced telescopes on land and in space, in which our Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC) teams are playing a significant role. It’s the low down on STFC’s contribution to world class astronomy – the technical innovations, the research and how we share new knowledge to inspire and capture the imagination of people both young and not so young.
        
        Astronomers learning about the Universe need big and powerful telescopes to see deep into space – to observe regions never seen before – to reveal the secrets of how the Universe has evolved, and tell us why it is the way it is today. They also need telescopes that capture different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, which comprises radio, microwave, infrared, visible, UV, x-ray and gamma ray. Using just one part of the spectrum would exclude large parts of the information available to us – rather like watching the 3D, high definition version of Avatar on an old black-and-white television. With the sound off.
        
        Professor Gillian Wright, Director of STFC’s UK Astronomy Technology Centre (UK ATC) at the Royal Observatory Edinburgh, talking about the world class technical innovations of STFC scientists and engineers says:
        
        “Our achievements, enabling world class science via state of the art hardware and software delivered to major international organisations, are a tribute to the hard work and expertise of staff across STFC and the UK astronomy community.  </h1>
    <p style="background-color:Tomato;">Huge advances in technical innovations have seen astronomers able to collect more and more light from the skies, through bigger and more advanced telescopes, to see deeper into the Universe – than has ever been seen before. This has been possible through collaborations across nations and disciplines.

        Simply called the Extremely Large Telescope – the ELT, which is currently in construction will be the largest and most powerful visible and infrared light telescope in the world. At a size of twice the length of a cricket pitch, if it were placed at Land’s End, it would be able to see a bumblebee at John O’Groats! By the late 2020s it will be delivering major breakthroughs in astronomy – observing the formation of distant galaxies and characterising planets around nearby stars with unique precision.
        
        The ELT is being built by the European Southern Observatory (ESO) at the Paranal Observatory on the Armazones Mountain in Northern Chile. Its scale makes it a feat of engineering, and its ambition makes it a feat of imagination. But building and designing the ELT is no small task; involving many teams around the world.</p>
